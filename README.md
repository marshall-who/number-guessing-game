# Number Guessing Game

This is a fun little guessing games made following a tutorial to get familiar with using JS to manipulate DOM elements. This tutorial covered how to select elements in the DOM using HTML tags, classes and ID's. I also learned to create functions using listner events to make changes dynamically based on user actions.

## How the games works

The basis of the games is to enter a number into a field between 1-20. Once a number is entered, click check and the game will give feedback letting you whether the number is too low or high. Everytime you guess wrong the score goes down. Give it a try and see quickly you can guess the correct number. Enjoy!

### Installation:

1. Upload the index.html, scripts.js and styles to the server. 
2. Open the index.html file in a browser.

### Usage:

1. Enter a number into the input field.
2. Click the check button.
3. Repeat steps until the number is guessed correctly.
4. Click on "Again" button to reset the game and play again.
